# Fire-Simulation

Overview:

This project simulates the spread of a wildfire using a Cellular Automata (CA) model, incorporating environmental factors such as wind speed, humidity, and tree density. The goal is to provide insights into wildfire dynamics and support fire management strategies.


Features:

Customizable Simulation Parameters: Adjust wind speed, humidity, and terrain density.

Real-Time Visualization: Uses Pygame and Matplotlib to animate fire spread.

Environmental Influence: Fire behavior is affected by wind direction and humidity.

Probabilistic Fire Spread Model: Incorporates stochastic rules for more realistic simulations.

Comparative Analysis: Evaluates CA-based modeling against physics-based and machine learning approaches.


Technologies Used:

Python (Core logic and simulation)

NumPy (Grid-based data processing)

Matplotlib (Data visualization and plotting)

Pygame (Interactive simulation rendering)

SciPy (Mathematical modeling, if needed)


Progress Update (3/29/2025)
Recent development has focused on structured testing and data collection to better quantify fire behavior. The simulation now logs key metrics (burning, burned, unburned trees) at each step, and multiple test cases have been executed across different environmental conditions. Results are documented using Markdown and LaTeX for analysis, with future improvements aimed at capturing more detailed spread metrics like fire rate and directional movement.
