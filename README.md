# Fire-Simulation

Overview:

This project simulates the spread of a wildfire using a Cellular Automata (CA) model, incorporating environmental factors such as wind speed, humidity, and tree density. The goal is to provide insights into wildfire dynamics and support fire management strategies.


Features:

Customizable Simulation Parameters: Adjust wind speed, humidity, and terrain density.

Real-Time Visualization: Uses Pygame and Matplotlib to animate fire spread.

Environmental Influence: Fire behavior is affected by wind direction and humidity.

Probabilistic Fire Spread Model: Incorporates stochastic rules for more realistic simulations.

Comparative Analysis: Evaluates CA-based modeling against physics-based and machine learning approaches.


Technologies Used:

Python (Core logic and simulation)

NumPy (Grid-based data processing)

Matplotlib (Data visualization and plotting)

Pygame (Interactive simulation rendering)

SciPy (Mathematical modeling, if needed)
