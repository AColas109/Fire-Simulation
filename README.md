# Fire-Simulation

Overview:
This project simulates the spread of a wildfire using a Cellular Automata (CA) model, incorporating environmental factors such as wind speed, humidity, and tree density. The goal is to provide insights into wildfire dynamics and support fire management strategies.

Features:

Customizable Simulation Parameters: Adjust wind speed, humidity, and terrain density.
Real-Time Visualization: Uses Pygame and Matplotlib to animate fire spread.
Environmental Influence: Fire behavior is affected by wind direction and humidity.
Probabilistic Fire Spread Model: Incorporates stochastic rules for more realistic simulations.
Comparative Analysis: Evaluates CA-based modeling against physics-based and machine learning approaches.

Technologies Used:
Python (Core logic and simulation)
NumPy (Grid-based data processing)
Matplotlib (Data visualization and plotting)
Pygame (Interactive simulation rendering)
SciPy (Mathematical modeling, if needed)
